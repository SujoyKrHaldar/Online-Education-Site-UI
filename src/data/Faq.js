    q: "Is this site a coding bootcamp?",
    a: "In short, no we’re not. We aim to offer the same value, but at 100X lower price, so there are differences. Scrimba allows you to study where you want, when you want. We also substitute the classroom teaching experience with interactive screencast, live events, and peer-to-peer help between students.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I get in-person help from teachers?",
    a: "Getting help at Scrimba is done peer-to-peer, meaning students help and support each other, instead of teacher-to-student. This is an important ingredient in being able to charge 1% of what coding bootcamps charge.",
  },
  {
    q: "When do the courses start?",
    a: "Whenever you want. Our courses are all self-paced, meaning you follow your own schedule. Sign up and get started today if you’d like!",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does the career path take?",
    a: "You can complete the career path in three months if you are fast. But it will realistically take you 6-12 months to reach a hireable level as a frontend developer.",
  },
  {
    q: "I have more questions. Who can I ask?",
    a: "Please join our Discord server and ask in the #general channel. There, you will be replies from both the community and Team Scrimba.",
